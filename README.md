📘 Why Bridges Don’t Just Fall: The Physics of Structural Resonance

This project is an interactive article that explores the fascinating physics behind structural resonance in bridges and buildings—how invisible forces like wind or footsteps can cause massive structures to sway, oscillate, or even collapse.

The article explains the concept of resonance through real-world case studies (like the Tacoma Narrows and Millennium Bridge), governing formulas, visual diagrams, and embedded simulations built using Python and animation tools.

I created this to deepen my understanding of structural dynamics and to share my passion for mechanical engineering, physics, and real-world problem solving.
